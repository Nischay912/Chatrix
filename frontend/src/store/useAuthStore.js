// step339: so we will have a zustand store , in which we can have many different states ; and then in our application , we can use it at any place ; either in App.jsx or in any of its children or in any of its grandchildren directly without prop-drilling i.e. without passing props manually to each component and then to component inside that component and so on.

// step340: lets first create the zustand store here below.
import { create } from "zustand";
import { axiosInstance } from "../lib/axios.js";
import toast from "react-hot-toast";

//  step341: now lets create a hook to use the zustand store here below ; just like we ahve hooks called useState and all.

// step342: set is a function provided by Zustand to update the state inside the store (like Reactâ€™s setState we have like setName and all) ; The function returns an object that contains your initial state and actions (functions).
export const useAuthStore = create((set) => ({

    // step360: lets create a state for the authenticated users , which will initially be null ; once the user has been checked if he is authenticated , then we will update this state with that user's object later there.
    authUser: null,

    // step361: also lets add a loading state below which will be initially true and checking the authenticity of the user when we visit the page for the first time.
    isCheckingAuth: true,

    // step397: lets define the isSigningUp variable initially be false.
    isSigningUp: false,

    // step445: now we will use a isLoggingIn state to check if we are logging in now or not.
    isLoggingIn: false,

    // step362: now lets create a function to check the authenticity of the user here below.
    checkAuth: async() =>{
        try {

            // step363: lets try to make a GET request to the backend ; and store the response in a variable here below.

            // step364: we make call just to "/" and not whole "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/check" ; its because in the axiosInstance we have already made the baseURL as the this much part : "http://localhost:3000/api" so in every GET request made using axiosInstance , the baseURL will always be : "http://localhost:3000/api" ; so we just make a GET request to "/suth/check" here below , and it automatically will be : "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/check" .
            const res = await axiosInstance.get("/auth/check")

            // step365: the response will give us a response which will either be the user object or error if user is not authenticated.

            // step366: so lets set the authUser state to that response here below ; and also make the checkingState to false as checking for authenticity is done now.
            set({authUser: res.data})

        } catch (error) {
            // step367: now if there comes any error , we can console log it here below.
            console.log("Error in authCheck:" , error);

            // step368: and then if we have some errors in doing the check , user is not authenticated , so keep the authUser state value as null still there.
            set({authUser: null});
        }

        // step369: we can also have a finally block here to run after the try-catch block here below.
        finally{
            // step370: finally ; either we succeed in checking the auth or not , we can make the checkingAuth state to false now as the checking process is done now.
            set({isCheckingAuth: false})

            // step371: see the next steps in App.jsx file now there.
        }
    },

    // step398: now lets define the signUp method here below ; which will take some data as input which will actually be the fullName , email and password.
    signUp: async(data) =>{
        // step399: at beginning only first lets set the isSigningUp state to true now as we are signing up now.
        set({isSigningUp: true})
        try {
            // step401: now here we will be sending a POST request to the endpoint to help signing up there using the sent data.
            const res = await axiosInstance.post("/auth/signup" , data)

            // step402: now we will update the authenticated user with the response we recieve back ; because in the backend's auth.controller.js file too we were sending back a response object at end of the signup function , once user signs up successfully there ; so that response will be sent from endpoint in the "res" above ; and we will update the authUser with that response object here below.
            set({authUser: res.data})

            // step403: and then lets send a react toast here below ; so for that see the next steps first in the step404.txt file now there.

            // step405: now lets use the toast here below to show a success message to the user that he has signed up successfully.
            toast.success("Account created successfully")

        } catch (error) {
            // step406: now here in catch section , lets put a toast for the error message here below ; using the below syntax by which we can access the error in axios.
            toast.error(error.response.data.message)

            // step407: see the next steps now in SignUpPage.jsx file now there.
        }

        // step400: and after the try-catch block , we can set the isSigningUp state to false now as signing up is done now.
        set({isSigningUp: false})
    },

    // step443: now similar to the signup function , we can create a login function here below for the login page too.

    // step444: now we will have the "data" as the email and password which will be recieved by this function here below.
    login: async(data) => {
        // step446: initially we are logging in now , so set the isLoggingIn state to true now.
        set({isLoggingIn: true})        

        // step447: rest below similar to the signup function written above.

        // step448: see the next steps now in LoginPage.jsx file now there.
        try {
            const res = await axiosInstance.post("/auth/login" , data)
            set({authUser: res.data})
            toast.success("Logged in successfully")

        } catch (error) {
            toast.error(error.response.data.message)
        }
        finally{
            set({isLoggingIn: false})
        }
    },

    // step454: lets make the logout function here below.
    logout: async(data) => {
        try{
            // step455: logout occurs very fast so no need to have isLoggingOut state for this here.

            // step456: lets make a post request now to the logout endpoint that will send the jwt token or cookie of the current logged in user to make the backend log out the user at the logout endpoint.
            await axiosInstance.post("/auth/logout")

            // step457: also we remove the current user from the authUser state here below , making it null again as user is logged out now.
            set({authUser: null})

            // step458: now show toast here below.

            // step459: see the next steps in the ChatPage.jsx file now there.
            toast.success("Logged out successfully")
        }
        catch{
            toast.error("Error in logging out")
            console.log("Logout error" , error)
        }
    }

    // step343: now we can create all the states here below.
    // authUser: {name: "Nischay" , _id: 123, age: 25},
    // isLoggedIn: false,

    
    // step344: we can also create functions inside the store this like done here below.
    
    // step345: now any of the pages in the app can use these states in any of the components directly now.
    
    // step346: we just have to go in App.jsx file there and see the next steps there.
    // login: () => {
        // console.log("We just logged in");

        // step352: now we can use the "set" function like the "setName and all of React" so that : we can update the states , like below , once login method is called we want to update the isLogeedIn state to true.

        // step353: so the set method below can be called with multiple key-value pairs to set multiple state's values at once too , like : if we had isLoading:true , then we can do : set({isLoading: true , isLoggedIn: true})

        // step354: also we can call this set function later in this login function after more coiple of lines of code inside this function , if it was there , we can call this set function again inside the same function again there too : so we can call the set function multiple times in a function too , thus here below.

        // step355: so now see the next steps in App.jsx where we will call this function from the zustand store to update the state value from false to true.
        // set({isLoggedIn: true});
    // }
}));
