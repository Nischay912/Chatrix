// step339: so we will have a zustand store , in which we can have many different states ; and then in our application , we can use it at any place ; either in App.jsx or in any of its children or in any of its grandchildren directly without prop-drilling i.e. without passing props manually to each component and then to component inside that component and so on.

// step340: lets first create the zustand store here below.
import { create } from "zustand";
import { axiosInstance } from "../lib/axios.js";
import toast from "react-hot-toast";
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

// step750: lets create a base url variable here below ; same as done in and explained in "axios.js" file earlier there.
const BASE_URL = import.meta.env.MODE === "development" ? "http://localhost:3000" : "/";

//  step341: now lets create a hook to use the zustand store here below ; just like we ahve hooks called useState and all.

// step342: set is a function provided by Zustand to update the state inside the store (like Reactâ€™s setState we have like setName and all) ; The function returns an object that contains your initial state and actions (functions).
export const useAuthStore = create((set,get) => ({

    // step360: lets create a state for the authenticated users , which will initially be null ; once the user has been checked if he is authenticated , then we will update this state with that user's object later there.
    authUser: null,

    // step361: also lets add a loading state below which will be initially true and checking the authenticity of the user when we visit the page for the first time.
    isCheckingAuth: true,

    // step397: lets define the isSigningUp variable initially be false.
    isSigningUp: false,

    // step445: now we will use a isLoggingIn state to check if we are logging in now or not.
    isLoggingIn: false,

    // step553:now lets make a state to control the laoder to show when uploading the profile picture.
    isUploadingProfile: false,

    // step745: lets create a state called socket first here below.
    socekt:null,

    // onlineUsers state created to be used later.
    onlineUsers: [],

    // step362: now lets create a function to check the authenticity of the user here below.
    checkAuth: async() =>{
        try {

            // step363: lets try to make a GET request to the backend ; and store the response in a variable here below.

            // step364: we make call just to "/" and not whole "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/check" ; its because in the axiosInstance we have already made the baseURL as the this much part : "http://localhost:3000/api" so in every GET request made using axiosInstance , the baseURL will always be : "http://localhost:3000/api" ; so we just make a GET request to "/suth/check" here below , and it automatically will be : "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/check" .
            const res = await axiosInstance.get("/auth/check")

            // step365: the response will give us a response which will either be the user object or error if user is not authenticated.

            // step366: so lets set the authUser state to that response here below ; and also make the checkingState to false as checking for authenticity is done now.
            set({authUser: res.data})

            get().connectSocket()

            console.log("Error in authCheck:" , error);

            set({authUser: null});
        }

        // step369: we can also have a finally block here to run after the try-catch block here below.

            set({authUser: res.data})

            // step403: and then lets send a react toast here below ; so for that see the next steps first in the step404.txt file now there.

            // step405: now lets use the toast here below to show a success message to the user that he has signed up successfully.
            toast.success("Account created successfully")

            // step762: same do in signup too there and also for checkAuth because even if user refresh the page , and by cookies he is still authenticated , the page should still show if online , so use it there too.

            const res = await axiosInstance.put("/auth/update-profile" , data)

            // step547: now lets set the authenticated user to the response we recieve back from the backend here below with the updated profile picture url.
            set({authUser: res.data})

            // step548: lets show some toast like here below.

    connectSocket: () => {
        // step747: first get the current state value for authenticated user from the state above.
        const authUser = get()
        // step748: if authenticated user not exist , then we can just return out of this function here below ; and no need to connect to the socket server now since the user is not logged in now i.e. since the user is not authenticated now.

        // step749: also in || part we say that if we are already connected , just return and don't try to connect again here below.
        if(!authUser || get().socket?.connected) return

        // step751: now lets create the socket connection here below ; so we will be connecting to the base url i.e. the backend and ensure that cookies are sent along with the handshake request so your socket authentication middleware can verify the user. 
        const socket = io(BASE_URL, {withCredentials: true})

        // step752: now we can connect to the socket server here below and then set the socket state with this socket connection here below.

        // step753: now we will be listening for events coming from backend via socket server here below.
        // step754: and as seen earlier , we use "socket.on" to listen for events using their name.

        // step755: so lets get the online user ids here below using the "getOnlineUsers" event name.
        socket.on("getOnlineUsers" , (userIds) => {

    // step757: now lets make another method here below to disconnect from the socket server.
    disconnectSocket: () => {
        // step758: first get the current state value for socket from the state above and then call the disconnect method on it, so that we can disconnect from the socket server here below ; so by disconnect() , we Calls Socket.IOâ€™s .disconnect() method on the client & This cleanly closes the WebSocket connection to the server ; On the server side, this will trigger the disconnect event for that socket.
    
        // get().socket?.disconnect()

        // step759: but to be more optimized lets call the disonnect , only if the socket is currently connected , else no need to call it obviously here below.

        // step760: now when we login we will call the connectSocket() method , so when we logout we will call the disconnectSocket() method here below.
        if(get().socket?.connected) get().socket?.disconnect()

    // step343: now we can create all the states here below.
    // authUser: {name: "Nischay" , _id: 123, age: 25},
    // isLoggedIn: false,

    
    // step344: we can also create functions inside the store this like done here below.
    
    // step345: now any of the pages in the app can use these states in any of the components directly now.
    
    // step346: we just have to go in App.jsx file there and see the next steps there.
    // login: () => {
        // console.log("We just logged in");

        // step352: now we can use the "set" function like the "setName and all of React" so that : we can update the states , like below , once login method is called we want to update the isLogeedIn state to true.

        // step353: so the set method below can be called with multiple key-value pairs to set multiple state's values at once too , like : if we had isLoading:true , then we can do : set({isLoading: true , isLoggedIn: true})

        // step354: also we can call this set function later in this login function after more coiple of lines of code inside this function , if it was there , we can call this set function again inside the same function again there too : so we can call the set function multiple times in a function too , thus here below.

        // step355: so now see the next steps in App.jsx where we will call this function from the zustand store to update the state value from false to true.
        // set({isLoggedIn: true});
    // }
}));
