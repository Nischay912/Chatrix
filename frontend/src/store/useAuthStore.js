// step339: so we will have a zustand store , in which we can have many different states ; and then in our application , we can use it at any place ; either in App.jsx or in any of its children or in any of its grandchildren directly without prop-drilling i.e. without passing props manually to each component and then to component inside that component and so on.

// step340: lets first create the zustand store here below.
import { create } from "zustand";
import { axiosInstance } from "../lib/axios.js";
import toast from "react-hot-toast";

//  step341: now lets create a hook to use the zustand store here below ; just like we ahve hooks called useState and all.

// step342: set is a function provided by Zustand to update the state inside the store (like Reactâ€™s setState we have like setName and all) ; The function returns an object that contains your initial state and actions (functions).
export const useAuthStore = create((set) => ({

    // step360: lets create a state for the authenticated users , which will initially be null ; once the user has been checked if he is authenticated , then we will update this state with that user's object later there.
    authUser: null,

    // step361: also lets add a loading state below which will be initially true and checking the authenticity of the user when we visit the page for the first time.
    isCheckingAuth: true,

    // step397: lets define the isSigningUp variable initially be false.
    isSigningUp: false,

    // step362: now lets create a function to check the authenticity of the user here below.
    checkAuth: async() =>{
        try {

            // step363: lets try to make a GET request to the backend ; and store the response in a variable here below.

            // step364: we make call just to "/" and not whole "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/check" ; its because in the axiosInstance we have already made the baseURL as the this much part : "http://localhost:3000/api" so in every GET request made using axiosInstance , the baseURL will always be : "http://localhost:3000/api" ; so we just make a GET request to "/suth/check" here below , and it automatically will be : "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/check" .
            const res = await axiosInstance.get("/auth/check")

            // step365: the response will give us a response which will either be the user object or error if user is not authenticated.

            // step366: so lets set the authUser state to that response here below ; and also make the checkingState to false as checking for authenticity is done now.
            set({authUser: res.data})

        } catch (error) {
            // step367: now if there comes any error , we can console log it here below.
            console.log("Error in authCheck:" , error);

            // step368: and then if we have some errors in doing the check , user is not authenticated , so keep the authUser state value as null still there.
            set({authUser: null});
        }

        // step369: we can also have a finally block here to run after the try-catch block here below.
        finally{
            // step370: finally ; either we succeed in checking the auth or not , we can make the checkingAuth state to false now as the checking process is done now.
            set({isCheckingAuth: false})

            // step371: see the next steps in App.jsx file now there.
        }
    },

    // step398: now lets define the signUp method here below ; which will take some data as input which will actually be the fullName , email and password.
    signUp: async(data) =>{
        // step399: at beginning only first lets set the isSigningUp state to true now as we are signing up now.
        set({isSigningUp: true})
        try {
            // step401: now here we will be sending a POST request to the endpoint to help signing up there using the sent data.
            const res = await axiosInstance.post("/auth/signup" , data)

            // step402: now we will update the authenticated user with the response we recieve back ; because in the backend's auth.controller.js file too we were sending back a response object at end of the signup function , once user signs up successfully there ; so that response will be sent from endpoint in the "res" above ; and we will update the authUser with that response object here below.
            set({authUser: res.data})

            // step403: and then lets send a react toast here below ; so for that see the next steps first in the step404.txt file now there.

            // step405: now lets use the toast here below to show a success message to the user that he has signed up successfully.
            toast.success("Account created successfully")

        } catch (error) {
            // step406: now here in catch section , lets put a toast for the error message here below ; using the below syntax by which we can access the error in axios.
            toast.error(error.response.data.message)

            // step407: see the next steps now in SignUpPage.jsx file now there.
        }

        // step400: and after the try-catch block , we can set the isSigningUp state to false now as signing up is done now.
        set({isSigningUp: false})
    }

    // step343: now we can create all the states here below.
    // authUser: {name: "Nischay" , _id: 123, age: 25},
    // isLoggedIn: false,

    
    // step344: we can also create functions inside the store this like done here below.
    
    // step345: now any of the pages in the app can use these states in any of the components directly now.
    
    // step346: we just have to go in App.jsx file there and see the next steps there.
    // login: () => {
        // console.log("We just logged in");

        // step352: now we can use the "set" function like the "setName and all of React" so that : we can update the states , like below , once login method is called we want to update the isLogeedIn state to true.

        // step353: so the set method below can be called with multiple key-value pairs to set multiple state's values at once too , like : if we had isLoading:true , then we can do : set({isLoading: true , isLoggedIn: true})

        // step354: also we can call this set function later in this login function after more coiple of lines of code inside this function , if it was there , we can call this set function again inside the same function again there too : so we can call the set function multiple times in a function too , thus here below.

        // step355: so now see the next steps in App.jsx where we will call this function from the zustand store to update the state value from false to true.
        // set({isLoggedIn: true});
    // }
}));
