  const {checkAuth , isCheckingAuth , authUser} = useAuthStore();

  // step373: now lets call the the checkAuth function here below to check if the user is authenticated or not as soon as the page is loaded here below using the useEffect with [checkAuth] as [checkAuth] means that : When the component first loads, call checkAuth() to check if the user is authenticated ; and even if by some means if the checkAuth function changes then will call this function again ; but in practice, Zustand store actions usually donâ€™t change, so it will usually run only once when the page loads so that it can check if the user is authenticated or not.
  useEffect(() => {
    checkAuth();
  }, [checkAuth])

  // step374: now lets console log the authUser state here below to check if the user is authenticated or not ; as it will be "null" if user is not authenticated ; else will have the user object in it.

  // step375: to run all this ensure to do npm run dev in both "cd frontend" and "backend" as well but we will get CORS error as the backend and frontend are at different PORTS , so the CORS policy prevents sending request to different PORTS ; so for that see the steps in step376.txt file now there.
  // console.log("Auth user:" , authUser);

  // step383: now if the checking is currently in progress , we can show a Page Loader Component here below.

  // step384: see the next steps in components folder's PageLoader.jsx file now there.

  // step347: we can now destructure all the states and the functions using the the zustand store named as useAuthStore here below.
  // const { authUser , isLoggedIn, login } = useAuthStore();

  // step348: lets try to console log the authUser state here below , to show that we can use the states now here in this component directly.

  // step349: we can see in frontend i.e. broswer's console that we can access and printed these values there ; so we can now easily access these state's values in our compontents directly now.

  // step350: now we can use them inside any of other components like signup page , login page , chat page , etc. :  by just importing the states using the hook we made : const { authUser , isLoggedIn } = useAuthStore(); in all of them and can use them there directly now.

  // step351: you can try it in those pages and after that see the next steps in useAuthStore.js file now there.
  // console.log("Auth user:" , authUser);
  // console.log("Is logged in:" , isLoggedIn);
