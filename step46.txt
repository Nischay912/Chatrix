Push all changes to github and then its ready for deployment as Savella deployment website also was linked to github , so will read the repository , so push all changes there now.

Go to Sevalla > Applications > Git repository > Select the git repository > checkbox the automatically deploy on commit : so that it automatically redeploys everytime we commit on github repository ; set location to closest to your area ; choose $5/month package to be used > create > go in environment variables > paste the env from here there > add .

Go to overview > Deploy now > it may show error to use upgraded version 20+ version of Node.js : so for that go on package.json file present outside both backend and frontend folder and there below the "main":"index.js" add these -

"engines":{
    "node":">=20.0.0"
  },

and then it will run the production in that version only there now : so again push the changes to the github ; and since we had checked the checkbox to run the deployment on every commit and push ; so it redeploys itself now.

There in deploy logs we may see Sevalla runs on 8080 port thats fine many different softwares run on different ports , it will adjust accordingly , thats why we had used the PORT in env variable so that it gets adjusted accordingly there.
