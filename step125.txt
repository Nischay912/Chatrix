Now , lets push the code in a new branch on Github and commit our changes.

We first press : ctrl+shift+p > create new branch > branch name : signup ; its like when we join a company , they create a new branch for us to work onn and commit our changes , and later we can send the officials PULL request to them , and they can see the changes and accept it if they approve and like it ; so we'll see similar process here now.

So after creating new branch > go on github icon on top in sidebar > then click on + there next to the changes at top there > it will stage all changes > then type the commit message : "signup controller created and added" > commit > publish branch.

Go now on github > we can see PULL request has come from another branch , we can click on Compare and pull request , there we can see that base branch is "master" and we have recieved pull request from "signup" branch there.

Click > create pull request > then the team-mate can come here and go on Commits on top > click on latest commit message there > and can see the addition happening in our code if we accept the pull request > and they can add comments using the + in blue appaearing when hovering over any new code lines added in green color there & write comments like : "this code is not clean , fix it" and can start the review there : later they will keep monitoring it and finally can merge the changesin their code there ; so since this whole is our account we are team-mate as well as coder so we can go back and again back and click on "merge pull request" to merge the changes of the PULL request in our code.

So , we later also saw AI like CodeRabbit and introduced some changes in the code , and then went on git icon of vs code sidebar > clicked on + there at top next to changes , to stage the changes > added some message of commit and commit > sync changes > now on github if refresh can see 2 Commits made in the "signup" branch now > now cna go to > conversation top navbar there and click on merge pull request & all changes will be added to our repository there now.

Now the github is updated but our vs code isn't , we if now see the status bar in footer of vs code ; in bottom left we have current branch name "signup" there > if we click that and come back to "master" , the changes made in "signup" won't be visible > so can click the recycle button there in bottom left to sync all changes there.
