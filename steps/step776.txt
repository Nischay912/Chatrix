Now we can open a window in chrom icognito for localhost:5173 and put edge and chrome side by side and see users login to see online in one another's window and it becomes offline when they log out too there.

Now we can commit our changes by doing : ctrl+shift+P > create new branch > name : online-users-setup > commit with message : online-offline functionality done and implemented > publish the branch > then on github merge the pull request.

Finally come back here on vs code : go on bottom left branch name > click > click to come back to master > click on sync OR the refresh icon on bottom left to sync all changes and commits to the main "master" branch ; so now we can see all the updated changes in the "master" branch finally now thus there/thus here.

See the next steps in "socket.js" file in the "lib" folder of backend now there.
