set up tailwindcss in vite from documentation using the 3.4.17 version ; by selecting it from the top when we go on tailwindcss.com and set up following the steps there.

now go on daisyUI.com and select the version 4 which we will be using to enhance th eusage of our tailwindCSS here ; go on the website > how to use > follow the steps > in : cd frontend > npm i -D daisyui@4.12.24 >paste the plugin given in documentation under tailwind.config.js file there along with the import statement there.

then you can see on the daisy ui website how to use it using various codes there.

now lets install "react-router" : React itself does not have any built-in way to handle page navigation (URLs, links, multiple views) : so : "react-router" helps you manage that — it decides which React component should show up when the browser’s URL changes ; This package helps us manage navigation and multiple pages inside a React single-page application ; Now when you click like : About, it loads the About Page without refreshing the browser — smooth navigation like a real app.

So, in cd frontend > do : npm i react-router > now lets set up the application to ahve multiple pages like : signup page , login page , chat page , etc : so to do so we do -

Go in : main.jsx and wrap the application with "BrowserRouter" there ; BrowserRouter → Wraps your app and listens to URL changes.

Now create a folder for pages and create mulitple pages files there ; and initially put default boilerplate in each of them using : rafce method there.

Then see the next steps in App.jsx file now there.
