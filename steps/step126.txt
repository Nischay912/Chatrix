Now to send a welcome mail to users when they sign up > go on : resend.com > sign in > docs > nodeJs icon select it > documentation > see the codes to get started with there.

In terminal > do cd backend > type : npm i resend > go in API keys section > create api key > chatrix > full access > add > copy the API key > in .env file > paste that API key ; also put some other things like > EMAIL FROM AND EMAIL FROM NAME THERE IN .env file > the domain can be set to ours too , but we don't have one , so lets use resend's email there in .env file.

Then we can create emails folder under src folder in backend and inside the emailTemplates.js file we make the email template there.

In the template , we have 2 parameters dynamic : username & the application_url based on the deployed domain as it will take us to the deployed website.

Then inside "lib" create "resend.js" file and see the next steps there now.
