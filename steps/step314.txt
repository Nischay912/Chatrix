Now lets do : ctrl+shift+P and create new branch > message-routes > stage all the changes in the git icon of sidebar by clicking on the + icon besides the Changes label there and then add commit message that messsage-routes implemented OR message routes added and publish the branch ; then we can go on github , merge the pull request and finally come back to this vs code and : go on bottom left branch name > click > click to come back to master > click on sync OR the refresh icon on bottom left to sync all changes and commits to the main "master" branch ; so now we can see all the updated changes in the "master" branch finally now thus there/thus here.

See the next steps in step315.txt file now there.
