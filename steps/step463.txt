Now we can commit our changes by doing : ctrl+shift+P > create new branch > name : login-frontend > commit with message : login and logout implemented on the frontend ; also the UI of signup page enhanced > publish the branch > then on github merge the pull request.

Finally come back here on vs code : go on bottom left branch name > click > click to come back to master > click on sync OR the refresh icon on bottom left to sync all changes and commits to the main "master" branch ; so now we can see all the updated changes in the "master" branch finally now thus there/thus here.

See the next steps in useAuthStore.js file there.
