Now we can commit our changes by doing : ctrl+shift+P > create new branch > name : chat-container-setup > commit with message : chat container setup done and implemented > publish the branch > then on github merge the pull request.

Finally come back here on vs code : go on bottom left branch name > click > click to come back to master > click on sync OR the refresh icon on bottom left to sync all changes and commits to the main "master" branch ; so now we can see all the updated changes in the "master" branch finally now thus there/thus here.

See the next steps in "useKeyboardSound.js" file in the "hooks" folder now there.
