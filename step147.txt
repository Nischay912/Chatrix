Now we go on : ctrl+shift+p > create new branch > name : welcome-email > go on the top icon of git in sidebar > click on + in the bar showing changes , to stage all the changes made > write commit message > commit > publish branch > go on github > create pull request > merge pull request > confirm merge.

So, github gets updated with the changes > now we if switch back to master branch , we won't be able to see the changes in local vs code as it has been implemented in the github only , not on the local git of our machine here.

So, for that we can click on bottom left : welcome-mail branch we are in > then click on master to come to master branch , we wont be able to see the changes we saved in welcome-mail branch , so click on the redresh type icon on bottom left there and click OK to sync all changes from github to the master branch too now.

Now to save this step147.txt > make sure to come out of all things and do git add . as this file is not inside the backen folder , so come outside using cd .. > then do those git add . , then git commit & finally git push there.

See the next steps now in the auth.route.js file now there.
