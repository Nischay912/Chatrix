// step295: now we want to return only those users under the chat section , with whom we have initiated chats and not the other contacts users of the database ; like if we have 100 contacts , but we have messages with only 2 of them, then under th chat section we want to return only those 2 users.

// step296: so we will try to fetch those messages where we are either the sender or the reciver and from those messages we will be extracting the senderId when we recieved it from sender OR recieverId for whom we sent the message to.
export const getChatPartners = async(req, res) => {
    try {
        // step297: so lets get the loggedInUserId here below like we did in the getAllContacts function above.
        const loggedInUserId = req.user._id;

            ]
        })

        // step299: now lets try to fetch the id of those with whom we had chat with.

        // step300: now we used .find() above which alwasy returns an array ; so it must have returned an array of messages where the loggedInUserId is either the sender or the reciever ; then now we run the map function below to iterate over each object in the array of objects named "messages" here below.

        // step301: then we have two options below ; we need to extract the other userId with whch we have done chat with anytime , as we have to display them under the CHAT section ; so when we are the reciever , the other user will be the senderId in the message & when we are the sender , the other user will be the recieverId in the message ; so we use ternary operator below to get the other user's id stored in the array named "chatPartnersIds" by checking in each message object that if that message involves the loggedIn user as sender , then the reciever will be the one to be displayed on chat screen & if the message has loggedIn user as reciever , then the sender will be the one to be displayed on chat screen ; that we achieve using the ternary operator below.

        // step302: we have used Set below which is a Javascript object that stores only unique values and no duplicates ; here we will not be showing the other user's 5 times in chat section if we have 5 messages with them ; we will show them once only , so thats why use Set to keep the other user's id only once for each of them in this "cahtPartnersIds" array below.

        // step303: we have used "..." the spread operator because the Set gives us a Set and not an array , so we use "..." to convert it back to array in each iteration , so that overall the chatPartnersIds will be an array of unique id's of all the users with whom we have had chat with ; So ... is used here to convert Set â†’ Array ; also we know "..." spread operator in each iteration keeps the old values and appends new values at end , making the data-structure to be an array with all ids in it being appended one after the other.

        // step304: we had toString() as senderId and recieverId are MongoDB ObjectIds, not normal strings ; but comparing two ObjectIds directly doesnâ€™t work correctly (=== will return false even if they look the same) ; so we use toString which : converts them into string format, so we can safely compare them ; so .toString() is used here to make IDs comparable.
        const chatPartnersIds = [...new Set
            (messages.map(msg =>
                msg.senderId.toString() === loggedInUserId.toString()
                ? msg.recieverId.toString() 
                : msg.senderId.toString()
            )
        )];

        // step305: now lets fetch these other users details from the database here below ; if they have their id present inside the "chatPartnersIds" array of unique id's of all the users with whom we have had chat with.

        // setp306: we did not want to return the password in the response , so we use select method to remove the password from the response below.
        const chatPartners = await User.find({ _id: { $in: chatPartnersIds } }).select("-password");

        // step307: now lets send the chatPartners as repsonse back here below.
        res.status(200).json(chatPartners)
        
    } catch (error) {
        // step308: any error if occurs , logged on console here below.
