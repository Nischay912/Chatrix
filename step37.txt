Now we went on Sevalla which is a deployment platform and we got $50 credits free , which we will use to deploy our website ; we can't use Netlify or Vercel as we will be using socket.io in our backend , which is not supported by Netlify or Vercel ; so we sign using github there now.

For now in our application , we are running our backend on localhost:3000 and frontend on localhost:5173 ; so instead of deploying them seperately , we can serve the frontend from the backend itself ; so that using a single URL , we can server both API endpoints as well as our static assets which is our React application here.

So click on the right sidebar i.e. not inside any folder but outside and then : in terminal type : npm init -y ; then here we will write scripts to prepare both frontend and backend for deployment; then we will kill temrinal aagin using dustbin button ; do : cd frontend > npm run build > to create a "dist" folder automatically with the optimized react app in it , production-ready react app comes in this "dist" folder here ; can delete this "dist" folder for now , can make anytime like this later too.

Now sevalla website will take our github repository to deploy it , but it needs to have node_modules in both frontend and backend there ; so to make sevalla do that when deploying , we go on the package.json file created outside both frontend and backend there ; and write there : under scripts that - "build" : "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend" ; this made as we know npm install installs all the node_modules , so we make it install it inside both frontend and backend there , so used --prefix above there.

But it also needs production ready react application so form it in the dist folder using npm run build after all the node_modules installed in both files there : so do : "build" : "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend" ; to run the npm run build under the frontend & then in next line there , write : "start" : "npm run start --prefix backend" to run the application under the backend as we have entry point as backend which will run the frontend too later indirectly.

Now for the deployment now > we go in server.js file of backend and write some code to make it ready for deployment there ; so see next steps there now.
